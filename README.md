# BootstrappArrr

## Naming

BootstrappArrr comes from the word bootstrapper and is a portmanteau word composed of the word "bootstrap" and "Arrr" the favorite cry of pirates.

## Purpose

BootstrappArrr initializes the automatic deployment of your server with only one click by using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) as configuration management tool.

The bootstrap process of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) can be configured and started via the web frontend in a browser or directly via the API of the web service. Typically, BootstrappArrr is started as a service during the first boot, so the process can be startet instantly.
